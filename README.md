# Amdocs-Training

This repository contains a jdbc project (java and sql).
Frontend is designed using JSP and servlet. 
Backend is Java and data base used is SQL.

This project uses Maven as a POM.
Maven makes sure that the dependency for connecting backend to fronend is added only once.
All the changes in the backend are hence automatically reflected in the front end.
We don't need to create separate jar files everytime we make changes in the backend.

The UI and functionalities have been added according to the pdf uploaded.
Do check the pdf for reference.
